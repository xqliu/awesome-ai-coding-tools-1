# Awesome AI Coding Tools [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of AI-powered tools for developers — editors, agents, code review, testing, CLI tools, MCP servers, and more.

AI coding has gone from autocomplete to autonomous teams in two years. This list helps you cut through the noise: the tools that ship, the tools that are interesting, and the tools that are quietly winning. Curated for working developers, not benchmark-chasers.
